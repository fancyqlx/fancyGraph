# fancyGraph

## Abstract
fancyGraph is a framework based on Message Passing Model for simulating distributed graph algorithms. 
Many distributed algorithms can be simulated by Message Passing Model. In this case, each node is regarded 
as a processor such that it runs an algorithm itself. The input it received were the messages delivered by
its neighbors. In the framework, we aim to provide several simple but useful funtions that helping
users to simulate distributed graph algorithms rapidly.
