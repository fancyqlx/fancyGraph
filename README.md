# fancyGraph

## Abstract
fancyGraph is a framework based on Message Passing Model for simulating distributed graph algorithms. 
Many distributed algorithms can be simulate by Message Passing Model, in this case, each node is regard 
as a processor such that it run an algorithm itself, the input it received were the messages delivered by
its neighbors. In this framework, we aim to provide several simple but useful funtions that helping
user to simulate distributed graph algorithms rapidly.
